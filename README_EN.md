# Final Project – Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It showcases my graphic design work, including digital paintings and logo designs. The goal was to create a professional, harmonious, and artistic space that reflects my design background.

## Challenges I Faced:

- At first, I had issues displaying my artwork properly because some of my images were vertical and some were horizontal. This made the gallery look uneven, and in some cases, my signature was cut off. I solved this by using properties like `object-fit`, `max-height`, and flexbox to balance the layout based on each image.

- Maintaining consistency across all pages in terms of color, fonts, spacing, and structure was a major challenge. This project helped me better understand how important harmony is in web design—especially when translating a graphic design vision into code.

- Coming from a graphic design background, writing HTML and CSS was new for me. However, I was able to translate my visual creativity into a structured website and really enjoyed the process.

- When I first uploaded my project to GitHub, the site appeared blank. I later realized it was because my main HTML file was named `home.html`. Once I renamed it to `index.html`, everything worked properly on GitHub Pages. This was a useful lesson in file naming and project publishing.
